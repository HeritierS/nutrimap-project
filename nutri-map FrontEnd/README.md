## Notes

- This repo was scaffolded from a template. Lovable-specific tooling and meta references have been removed so you can work locally and independently.
- If you need to deploy, build with `npm run build` and serve the `dist` output with your preferred host.

If you want me to add developer scripts, CI, or deployment instructions, tell me where you'd like to deploy and I'll add them.

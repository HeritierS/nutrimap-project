Removed UI content from `nutri-map FrontEnd/src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx`:

1) Demo notice (moved here):

"Demo Notice: This is a demonstration version using mock data. All information shown is for educational and prototype purposes only."

2) Version / Tech notes (moved here):

- v1.0.0 — Version
- React — Framework
- TypeScript — Language

Notes:
- These lines were removed from the Profile page UI and intentionally moved to this documentation file so they are still available for reference but not shown in the application UI.
- If you'd prefer these notes to be placed in the frontend README or another location (for example `nutri-map FrontEnd/README.md`), tell me where and I will move them.
